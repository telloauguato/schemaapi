title: Name type
description: Name type structure

## Overview

The `name` type is designed to generate realistic fictitious names, useful in development and testing scenarios where personally identifiable data is required but should not correspond to real individuals.



## Parameters

| Name          | Type      | Description                          |
|---------------|-----------|--------------------------------------|
| `type`        | `string`  | Type of data that will be returned. Must be assigned as `name`. |
| `join` | `boolean`  | Defines whether the result should be returned as a string (`true`) or object (`false`). The default value is `true`.    |

When using attributes from [Inherited Property String](/docs/types/all-types#string) and the `join` attribute is set to `true`, these attributes are returned within the body of the return object.
