# Types

The types follow a pattern where each type will have a `key` that represents the name of the object to be displayed when the data is generated and a `type` that indicates the type of data expected. These are mandatory.

```json showLineNumbers copy filename="default body"
{
    "key": "<nameOfKey>",
    "type": "<typeOfData>"
}
```

## Name

```json showLineNumbers copy filename="name type"
{
    "key": "username",
    "type": "username"
}
```
