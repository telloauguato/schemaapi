# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for **SchemaAPI**, a powerful and versatile tool designed to generate mock data for prototype systems. SchemaAPI allows developers to create realistic, personalized data to test and validate their applications during development.

## What is SchemaAPI?

SchemaAPI is a tool that allows you to define and manage data schemas for your applications. It provides a way to create simulated data based on these schemas, which can be useful for testing, prototyping, and application development.

### Main features

- **Custom Data Generation**: Define custom schemas to generate data that meets your specific needs.
- **Multiple Data Types Support**: Generation of a wide variety of data types, including names, addresses, numbers, dates and more.
- **Simple and Intuitive API**: Easy-to-use RESTful interface, facilitating integration with any application.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Adjust parameters and data patterns as needed.

### Use case

Imagine you are developing a new customer management application and need realistic data to test the system. With SchemaAPI, you can define a schema to generate customer names, addresses, phone numbers, and even order and transaction information. This allows you to validate your application's functionality and identify issues before going to production.

### Quick Example

Here is a simple example of how to use SchemaAPI to generate dummy user data:

1. **Define the Schema**:

    ```json
    {
      "name": "SchemaAPI",
      "description": "My first schema",
      "length": 1,
      "seed": 9820,
      "info": false,
      "version": 1,
      "content": {
        "name": "name",
        "email": {
          "type": "email",
          "domain": "schema.api"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

2. **Make an API Request**:

    ```sh
    curl -X POST https://schemaapi.vercel.app/api \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
          "name": "SchemaAPI",
          "description": "My first schema",
          "length": 1,
          "seed": 9820,
          "info": false,
          "version": 1,
          "content": {
            "name": "name",
            "email": {
              "type": "email",
              "domain": "schema.api"
            }
          }
        }'
    ```

3. **Receive Generated Data**:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john.doe34@schema.api"
      }
    ]
    ```

With these simple steps, you can generate custom dummy data to use in your testing and development. SchemaAPI makes it easy to create realistic data, allowing you to focus on developing features and improving the quality of your software.
