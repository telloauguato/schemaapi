# Inherited Properties

Inherited properties refer to properties that are automatically assigned to a type based on its default definition or behavior. In essence, these properties are inherent to the type and apply regardless of how it is used.

Here is the list of available inherited properties:

import { Cards, Card } from "nextra/components";
import { CaseSensitive, Hash, Braces, Brackets } from "lucide-react";

<Cards>
 <Card icon={<CaseSensitive />} title="String" href="/inherited/string" />
 <Card icon={<Hash />} title="Number" href="/inherited/number" />
 <Card icon={<Braces />} title="Object" href="/inherited/object" />
 <Card icon={<Brackets />} title="List" href="/inherited/list" />
</Cards>
